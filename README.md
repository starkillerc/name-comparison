# Name Comparison Engine

This project implements a high-performance phonetic name comparison engine in C++ using SIMD (AVX/AVX512) and multithreading.

## üîç Idea

In face comparison, a face is converted into a feature vector, where each axis represents a specific trait (e.g., lip shape, eye distance). Comparison is then performed using cosine similarity.

I applied the same concept to names.

- A name is broken down into phoneme pairs.
- Each phoneme pair corresponds to a unique axis in a fixed-size vector.
- The name is thus represented as a high-dimensional feature vector.
- Similarity is computed via a **modified cosine distance**, taking vector length into account.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Phonetic Encoding**  
   Names are converted into a normalized sound signature using a custom mapping across multiple alphabets (Latin, Cyrillic, Armenian).

2. **Vector Generation**  
   For each adjacent phoneme pair, a specific index in the vector is incremented. This results in a unique ‚Äúsound vector‚Äù for each name.

3. **Distance Calculation**  
   The vectors are compared using AVX instructions for acceleration. A modified cosine distance is used to account for vector magnitude (word length sensitivity).
   Standard cosine similarity was not suitable, as it ignored vector length ‚Äî but in my algorithm, name length directly affects vector size. I replaced it with a modified formula:
   (A ¬∑ B) / max(||A||, ||B||)¬≤,
   which preserves direction while penalizing mismatched lengths.

5. **Multithreading**  
   Vector comparison is parallelized across threads, achieving significant speedup on large datasets (2M+ comparisons per batch).
